# Covid19-Checker
While the whole world is suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to make a project which is
quite relevant and also a requirement in these challenging times. Our project, COVID-19 checker
is basically a self-checker which will guide you to access your or your near one's health conditions
and give you a sense of clarity on whether you need to get tested and/or follow other safety measures.

In present scenario, it is quite obvious of people developing anxieties regarding their health conditions.
And all those which add unnecessary fuel to it are fake WhatsApp forwards and numerous social media
articles. It is quite natural to feel anxious and stressed out at these times about your health but it should not turn into
panic. After all it is of utmost importance in these times to remain mentally positive and avoid negativity.
So we have come up with this project that may probably help to somewhat ease out your anxieties.
Feeling unwell, why not have a check in our COVID-19 Self-Checker?

For making this website, we have made use of the following:

	*Front End:- HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
	*Online COVID-19 API for loading live stats

Our project consists of a stats loaded front page where you will find live COVID-19 stats of India, health tips and facts.
Next few pages consist of a simple questionnaire and after giving your responses it will take you to the last page where you 
will get the result of your check. 

Running our software is quite simple. 
	*Unzip the folder
	*Open the index.html file in the browser of your local machine
